This project presents an Egg Classification System developed using the MSP430G2 microcontroller.
The system dynamically measures egg weights via a load cell, processes the data using the microcontroller’s internal ADC, and classifies eggs as small, medium, or large based on predefined weight thresholds.

An instrumentation amplifier (INA128) and signal conditioning circuitry were designed to amplify low-level sensor signals, while real-time feedback is provided through a Nokia LCD5110 display.
The project demonstrates practical skills in embedded systems, analog signal conditioning, ADC-based data acquisition, and real-time user interaction.
